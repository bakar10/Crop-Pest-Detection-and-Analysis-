# Crop Pest Detection and Analysis using Pyke

## üìë Overview

- This project is aimed at providing farmers with a solution to identify pests that could attack their crops and cause damage. It also provides farmers with suggestions on insecticides to use to deal with the pests.

- The system works by taking in a certain crop as an input and then querying the Pyke knowledge engine to retrieve a list of pests that could attack the crop. After identifying the pests, the system then uses analysis techniques to suggest the best insecticides to use in dealing with the pests.

- This project is written in Python and uses the Pyke knowledge engine.

## üìù Requirements

- To run this model, you will need the following:
  Python 3.6 or higher-
  TensorFlow 2.0 or higher-
  Keras 2.0 or higher-
  Scikit-learn-
  Pandas-
  Numpy-
  pyke

## üíª Installation

- To install the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository and install the required libraries using pip:

```
git clone https://github.com/bakar10/Crop-Pest-Detection-and-Analysis-
cd dir
pip install pyke
```

## üîß Usage

- To use the system, follow these steps:

1- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2- Run the [driver.py](https://github.com/bakar10/Crop-Pest-Detection-and-Analysis-/blob/main/Pyke/driver.py) script.

```
python driver.py
```

3 Follow the prompts to enter the crop you want to analyze.

```
Please enter the name of the crop you want to analyze: corn
```

4- The system will then display a list of pests that could attack the crop.

```
The following pests could attack corn:
- Corn earworm
- European corn borer
- Fall armyworm

```

5- The system will then use analysis techniques to suggest the best insecticides to use in dealing with the pests.

```
The following insecticides are recommended:
- Bacillus thuringiensis
- Carbaryl
- Cypermethrin
```

## üìì Results

The crop pest detection and analysis project was tested on various crops to determine the accuracy of the system in identifying pests and recommending insecticides to deal with them.

In the first test, we analyzed the crop tomato. The system correctly identified the pests that could attack the crop, including the tomato fruitworm, the tomato hornworm, and the aphid. The system also provided accurate recommendations for insecticides to use, including Bacillus thuringiensis and spinosad.

In the second test, we analyzed the crop Sunflower. The system correctly identified the pests that could attack the crop, including the Scarabs. The system also provided accurate recommendations for insecticides to use, including Systemic Insecticide.

Overall, the results indicate that the crop pest detection and analysis project is an accurate and effective solution for identifying pests that could attack crops and recommending insecticides to deal with them. The system can help farmers to prevent crop damage and increase crop yield.
